## Description

productLifter is a two-part application consisting of:

- a backend API (Node.js + Express)  
- a frontend client (likely HTML/JS/CSS)  

The intent is to provide a platform where users can manage products — create, read, update, delete — and interact via a modern user interface.  

Given your background (Node.js / Express), productLifter is a lightweight but functional starting point for product-management and can be extended for future needs (authentication, user roles, advanced filtering, etc.).
